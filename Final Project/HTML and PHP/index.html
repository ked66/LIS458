    <h1>Welcome to the Historical Pharmacopeia!</h1>

    <h2>What's Here?</h2>
    <p>On this site, you'll find information about how herbs have been used medicinally throughout history.
      There are quotes from original, historical medical texts saying, for example, that Hippocrates recommended
      Aloe for hernias. For many herbs and indications, there is also information from the National Center for
      Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) about whether modern research has supported or questioned
      the herb's medicinal use.</p>
    <p>You can browse by herb, medical indication, or author of the source text. You can search by herb, medical
      indication, source text, and author of the source text.</p>

    <h2>Where Did the Data Come From?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Information from the NCCIH, including common names for herbs and modern research, was scraped from their web section <a href = 'https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance'>Herbs at a Glance</a></li>
      <li>Medical Indications controlled vocabulary comes from <a href = 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh'>MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)</a>, maintained by the National Library of Medicine</li>
      <li>All other information came from general resources, such as Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Brittanica</li>
    </ul>
